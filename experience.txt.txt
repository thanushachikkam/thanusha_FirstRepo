I entered IIT Patna on Nov 4th morning around 10 am.I felt like my dream of achievig IIT is accomplished.Though I felt bad of losing seat in IIT madras, but I am satisfied with M&c department in IIT patna. I came to asima hostel and a room was alloted,then i went for doc verification where i met my new friends.my father bought a new bicycle evening. I was feeling bit happy, bit sad coz I lost my madras seat and very responsible by seeing my father. I met my roomated who were hindi people. I can only understand hindi. BUT i cant talk due to inferiority complex. The orientation wass literallyy boringgg.....i dont want to remind it againn....thenn camee thee infinitoo withh gosh damn funfinito....i enjoyed a lot there...i tried kulhad pizza 1st day...second day i danced in musical night...and the lasttt pronite dj night was like hell....i am gettig habituated here...and started liking the campus...hope i will leave this campus by grabbing my dream package 50lakhs
